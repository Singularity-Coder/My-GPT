# My-GPT
Run GPT python code on Android using Android scripting!

So the basic idea is to 
1. Get Karpathy's nonoGPT code - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY
2. Use android scripting to run python code - https://opensource.googleblog.com/2009/06/introducing-android-scripting.html
3. Both text and image generation. Merge this with "Assist Me" once done.
